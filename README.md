arduino-nextbus
===============

Arduino based project. This device will tell me the time, next 3 bus' times, and the weather. It will be battery backed with a solar charger. Rough estimate is that the device should run for 24 hours solely on the battery which is important where winter exists. 

Current status: Planning. Pushed test code into repo without any on hands testing.
